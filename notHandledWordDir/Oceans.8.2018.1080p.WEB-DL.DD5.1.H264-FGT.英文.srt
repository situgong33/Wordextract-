fuckyou
6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,810
Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,840
Hi.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,580
As you know, parole is a privilege.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,310
And one of the restrictions on any parolee,

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,850
is to avoid the company

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,920
of any person who has a criminal record of any kind.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,090
That would include most of your extended family.

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,990
Yeah, that's obviously not something I'm proud of.

14
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,330
Would this pose an impossible challenge for you?

15
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,760
No. No.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,160
I don't want that life. I never wanted that life.

17
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,030
My brother, um...

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,330
May he rest in peace,

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,470
was a criminal.

20
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,270
I loved him,

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,570
but he was a conman.

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,840
It was in his blood.

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,710
- And it's not in your blood? - No.

24
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,240
No, sir.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,520
I fell for the wrong person.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,920
It was a mistake.

27
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,720
But it happened.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,790
And if I were to be released, I would, um...

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,460
Sorry.

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,600
Wow, just saying that...

31
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,640
If I were to be released,

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,870
I would just want the simple life.

33
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,210
I just wanna hold down a job,

34
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,740
make some friends,

35
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,920
go for a walk after work in the fresh air

36
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,850
and pay my bills.

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,500
Simple life?

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,670
Nice one.

39
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,440
- Heard about that? - Who didn't?

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,640
I had five years to rehearse it.

42
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,550
- Here's your stuff. - Thank you.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,320
Nice watch.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,120
- It's my brother's. - Left it to you?

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,750
I stole it.

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,090
It's fine, Dina. He stole it, too.

47
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,160
So we're still gonna get a regular shipment next week.

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,060
You take your cut, plus a few extra cartons, okay?

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,760
I want you to trade 'em, not smoke 'em.

50
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,600
So where you going?

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,540
I can go anywhere I want.

55
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,640
Hi, I'd like to return these.

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,170
Oh, of course. Do you have your receipt?

57
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,210
No, but they're unopened. They haven't been touched.

58
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,050
I really need your receipt.

60
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,150
They are sealed. They are brand new.

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,020
Do you have the credit card that you used?

62
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,520
This is ridiculous! I bought these last week.

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,390
Ma'am, you can try client services on the sixth floor.

64
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,360
You know what? Never mind. I'll just keep 'em.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,790
Jesus.

66
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,230
Can I at least get a bag?

67
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,230
Sure.

68
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,670
Thank you.

69
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,950
Hi. I'm checking out of room 2814. Gary Randall.

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,080
- Did you have a pleasant stay? - Terrific.

71
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,920
My name is Monica.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,220
Is there anything else I can do for you?

73
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,350
Or arrange transportation?

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,590
I think we're all set.

75
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,190
Hi, this is Mrs. Randall.

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,930
We just checked out of room 2814.

77
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,530
May I speak with Monica, please?

78
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,230
- This is she. - Hi, Monica.

79
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,400
- Hi. - Hi.

80
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,370
Uh, we just found out our flight was canceled.

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,770
- Oh, no! - I know, I know.

82
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,970
And instead of staying

83
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,470
in some horrible airport hotel,

84
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,740
we were hoping that maybe

85
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,340
we could get our original room back?

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,210
Yeah, we can give you that same room back.

87
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,110
That would be amazing! Thank you so much!

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,620
Um, we're just gonna go grab a bite.

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,720
Would it be possible to get the maid in there now?

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,050
Yes, absolutely.

91
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,990
Perfect. We really appreciate it.

92
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,490
It's not a problem.

93
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,990
Thank you so much. We'll see you soon.

94
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,740
Hi.

95
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm so sorry. Can you finish up later?

96
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,510
I just have to get off my feet.

97
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,970
- Of course. - Thank you so much.

98
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,410
- Have a great day. - You, too!

99
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,050
Bye-bye.

100
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,050
And he did not move in!

101
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,720
And he wants his money back.

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,620
And he gets his money back.

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,020
If you said no, does that mean you didn't take the money?

104
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,690
What crate are you on?

105
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,890
15.

106
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,090
Listen.

107
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,600
You think I like you? You think I believe you?

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
You think I trust anything that you're saying?

109
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,670
The answer is absolutely not.

110
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,740
Guys, it's 9:30.

111
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,610
It's too much. It's too much.

112
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,480
It's three fingers from the top.

113
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,810
Not one, it's three.

114
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,710
It's a rerun, April.

115
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
She slept with her cousin, crashed the car.

116
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,580
The baby's not his.

117
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,260
What's that taste like?

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,990
Vodka.

119
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,530
Vodka. Exactly. But I don't want vodka.

120
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,830
I want vodka and water.

121
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,300
- And do you wanna know why? - Uh, sure.

122
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,130
'Cause when you're drunk, it tastes like vodka.

123
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,040
- Right. - Right.

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,670
I don't care!

126
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,740
Oh, missed you, too.

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,560
You better be in there.

128
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,560
I know you're there, Reuben.

130
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,770
You can come on out.

131
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,970
I was just paying my respects.

132
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,410
From around the corner?

133
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,010
What are you doing here?

134
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,680
They thought I'd be the best one to talk to you.

135
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,080
Hmm. Gotta go.

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
He didn't want you to do this, Deborah.

137
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,320
Do what?

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,490
Whatever it is he wouldn't tell us you're gonna do.

139
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,370
Look, Deb.

140
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,720
Sometimes, just knowing the job will work

141
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,360
is satisfaction enough.

142
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,030
You don't actually gotta do it.

143
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,830
What else did he say?

144
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,170
- He said it was brilliant. - Oh, okay.

145
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,140
And that you would probably end up back in prison.

146
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,480
I'm not gonna end up back in prison.

147
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,650
Okay?

148
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,290
I gotta go.

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,120
Be careful.

150
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,560
You're looking sharp.

151
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,870
Take it easy.

152
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,170
Been in the slammer.

153
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,950
Oh, I just thought you changed your number.

154
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,910
Did you get the credit line?

155
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,850
- Not yet. - Why not?

156
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,920
Because I don't know what it's for.

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
Oh, my God!

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,590
Don't do that.

159
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,660
Do what?

160
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,160
That would be my "I've just been in jail for five years,

161
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,390
"And my partner lets me down" Face.

162
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,870
Hey, I'm not your partner. Yet.

163
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,860
This is nice.

164
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,570
Chain-link, barb wire.

165
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,140
Brought you something.

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,440
Can I exchange something you stole?

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,180
Well, if you're gonna have a problem with stealing,

168
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,010
you're not gonna like the rest of this conversation.

169
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,950
- What, we're gonna shoplift? - Maybe.

170
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,350
No. See, this is what you do.

171
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,350
You make me guess and then, I'm interested.

172
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,050
- Okay. - And then you think because

173
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm interested, that I wanna do it.

174
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,220
Don't you wanna do things you're interested in?

175
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm interested in brain surgery.

176
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,360
Well, we know that's not gonna happen.

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,260
Whatever. You don't wanna tell me...

178
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,500
It's jewels.

179
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,800
Spectacular, great, big, blingy,

180
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,300
big old Liz Taylor jewels,

181
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,540
that are locked in a vault 50 feet underground.

182
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
How do we get them out of the vault?

183
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,020
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

184
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,220
Oh, bugger!

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,020
Nice place.

186
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,530
Try heating it.

187
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,960
There's a room for you upstairs.

188
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,860
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

189
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,360
You know, I borrowed some shit.

190
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,470
Figured you weren't using it.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,140
So, is this your gallery?

195
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah, one of them.

196
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,970
Where are the others?

197
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,340
Well, I'm opening one in London.

198
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,970
Got plans for another one in Tokyo.

199
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,080
We're talking about LA,

200
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
but I'm not sure that makes sense.

201
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,840
It's all a bit derivative out there, you know?

202
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,980
So this is the only one that exists?

203
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,490
Well... Physically.

204
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,420
Excuse me one second.

205
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,560
Sorry. Sorry.

206
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,700
Oh, my God.

207
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,360
I was meaning to call you.

208
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,370
Jesus, it's great to see you. You look...

209
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,900
Recently incarcerated?

210
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,470
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

211
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,210
Do you know what a shiv is?

212
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,640
Okay, stop. Just stop.

213
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,980
Oh, such a nice face.

214
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,110
You know, inside,

215
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,180
you're what we call a pretty girl.

216
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,350
- I'll call the police. - Okay.

217
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,020
Do you know what we do with snitches?

218
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,130
- He saw you? - Oh, yeah.

219
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,060
Why would you do something like that?

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,770
Closure?

221
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,000
Bullshit!

222
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,970
Jesus!

223
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,280
So did you...

224
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,410
No.

225
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,840
Just a little button.

226
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,530
So at first, I thought banks. 'Cause you know...

227
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,900
That's where they have money?

228
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,930
Exactly. But that's kind of boring.

229
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,240
So then I thought ten banks.

230
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,640
Then I realized that would be maybe

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,170
coming from an angry place so...

232
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,640
Good you realized that.

233
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,540
Yes. Then I couldn't even hear myself think.

234
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,710
You know, five women in one cell.

235
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,450
So I got myself thrown in solitary

236
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,580
for a little peace and quiet,

237
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,090
and that's where I finally came up with it.

238
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
- It's still a museum. - So?

240
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,190
So, it's not like robbing a liquor store.

241
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,120
I'm sorry, I don't speak Ukrainian.

242
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,820
I said, "We're not robbing a museum."

243
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,830
We're robbing someone...

244
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,190
In a museum.

245
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,760
Yeah, you mentioned.

246
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,230
Look.

247
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,930
- Even if this was possible... - It is possible.

248
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,840
Even if it was, we'd need, like,

249
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,100
20 people and half a million dollars.

250
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,240
Seven.

251
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,370
Seven million?

252
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,180
Seven people and 20 grand.

253
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,580
Why do you need to do this?

254
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,720
Because it's what I'm good at.

255
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Uh, yeah.

256
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,690
You know what?

257
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,160
I have run this thing a thousand times.

258
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,890
Every time I got caught, I fixed it.

259
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,690
And in three years, I wasn't getting caught anymore.

260
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,590
By the time I was paroled, it was running like clockwork.

261
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
Perfectly.

262
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:52,330
And you were there with me, every step of the way.

263
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,230
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,870
Baby, I don't have a diamond yet.

265
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,510
Come on. Do you really wanna spend the rest

266
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,140
of your life watering down well vodka?

267
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,450
Because it's really kind of a waste.

268
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,180
Come on. Take a bite.

269
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,250
Just take a bite.

270
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,650
- You're really irritating. - Open.

272
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,360
That's good.

273
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,860
Very good.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
So each year they host

275
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,730
the biggest party in the world.

276
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,270
And they always get a huge celebrity to host.

277
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,730
This year, it's Daphne Kluger.

278
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,600
Yeah. But she's not our mark.

279
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,810
So who's the mark?

280
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,340
All right, who wants to go first?

281
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,180
Yes.

282
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,610
Do you know who you're wearing?

283
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,350
La Perla. It's black.

284
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,650
No, I mean who's dressing you?

285
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,450
I don't really know yet.

286
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,190
The designer.

287
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,160
I don't know yet.

288
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,660
But as soon as I do,

289
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,860
you'll be the very first person that I tell.

290
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,800
Uh, next question?

291
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,070
All right, we need a designer.

292
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,330
Exactly!

293
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,630
Now a lot of these we could target.

294
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,870
But Anna won't approve them,

295
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,400
and Anna has to approve everything.

296
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,740
I know.

297
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,410
There's a few less-established choices,

298
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,910
but they're not gonna give us the juice we need.

299
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,910
So...

300
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,440
Rose Weil. Why do I know that name?

301
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,380
Well, she was big, in the '90s.

302
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,720
Oh, God, all the Edwardian collars and the ruffles.

303
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,890
Travesty. But Anna still likes her.

304
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,450
They do Easter together every year in Kent.

305
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,660
- Brits? - Irish.

307
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,460
And she owes the IRS $5 million.

308
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,660
It's bad.

309
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,930
There's a lien on her assets,

310
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,130
they've impounded her passport.

311
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,670
The bank seized her townhouse.

312
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,170
She sounds amazing.

313
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,270
Yeah.

314
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,540
I think we got lucky.

315
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,740
She gambled everything on this.

316
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,180
This is a flight to nowhere without any peanuts.

317
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,650
Self-financed. Credit from an Omaha bank.

318
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,020
Those guys over there?

319
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,290
The only ones who'll still loan her money.

320
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,890
They look a little worried.

321
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,830
Yeah, who can blame them? This is a train wreck.

322
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,880
Congratulations.

323
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,250
Who are you?

324
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,390
Big fans.

325
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,120
Very big.

326
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,260
- That was... - Just...

327
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,320
Gorgeous.

328
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,760
No, it wasn't.

329
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,430
It was a disaster.

330
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,330
I think you're being kind of hard on yourself.

331
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,570
Very.

332
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,340
Did you read this?

333
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,200
It's by a blogger.

334
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,410
"Rose Weil.

335
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,210
"Her new collection is like taking a tour

336
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,710
of your grandmother's closet.

337
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,480
"Just as dated, and just as musty.

338
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,390
"The Eskimo shove their elders out on an ice floe.

339
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,490
"Just saying."

340
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,260
That's very cruel.

341
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,220
But it doesn't make it true.

342
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,630
How did I get here?

343
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,900
You spent $18 million in two years

344
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,870
and had two houseboats on the Seine.

345
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,670
I'm old.

346
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,570
Hey, you're not old.

347
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm old, and I'm going to prison.

348
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,240
Then I'm going to be really, really poor.

349
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,380
Not necessarily.

350
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,180
What if we could make all this go away?

351
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,690
Even get your passport back.

352
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,520
How?

353
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,860
Dress Daphne Kluger for the Met Ball.

354
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,830
Are you mad?

355
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,630
No, hang on a minute.

356
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,870
Are you journalists?

357
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,740
- Absolutely not. - God, no.

358
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,780
- Hmm. She seems sort of tense. - Can be.

359
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,110
Good body. Good boobs. Huge features.

360
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,880
Eyes like Bambi.

361
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,780
Yeah. She can take quite a lot.

362
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,550
Maybe we could give her... Maybe...

363
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,120
Maybe we could give her this.

364
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,530
God, no. Not chic. We can do better than that.

365
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,160
It's called the Toussaint.

366
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,530
Named for Jeanne Toussaint,

367
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,400
Cartier's director of jewelry from '33 to '68.

368
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,940
It's over six pounds of diamonds.

369
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,070
Right.

370
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,140
After she died, they sold it back to Cartier,

371
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,810
and they've kept it in their vault ever since.

372
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,610
They've never let it out.

373
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,010
So then, how are we gonna get it out?

374
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,420
Well, they might let it out for her.

375
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,920
The theme of this year's ball

376
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,390
is European royalty...

377
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,490
...of which the crown jewels are a featured element.

378
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:49,760
So, if you were to insist on the Toussaint

379
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,970
on behalf of Daphne Kluger...

380
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,480
Must be worth quite a lot.

381
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,780
Yeah.

382
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,780
- These are all Russians. - They're hackers.

383
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,280
Are there no hackers who aren't Russian?

384
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,950
No, there's barely any Russians who aren't hackers.

385
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,160
- Just keep looking, please. - Sure.

396
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,650
Okay.

397
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,270
Sorry about Danny.

398
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,840
Sorry about your pops.

399
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,740
So, what are you doing here?

400
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,180
I might have something for you.

401
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,280
A job.

402
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,450
You wanna run some stuff through the store?

403
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,220
No, thank you.

404
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,720
A little more than that.

405
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,920
How long would it take you

406
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,160
to make seven pieces of jewelry,

407
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,520
if the stones were already cut?

408
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,260
Probably five or six hours.

409
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,460
How long if I told you you didn't have to

410
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,770
live with your mother anymore?

411
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,270
Less.

412
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,270
I'm never taking the F-train again.

413
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,480
She's in.

414
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,310
She is in where?

415
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,780
This what you talking about? Bunch of vases.

416
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,320
Yeah, that's the Egyptian wing.

417
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,450
She's in the Met?

418
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,320
Security cameras.

419
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,160
There's a lot of 'em.

420
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,190
My name's Debbie.

421
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,630
- Nine Ball. - What's your real name?

422
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,690
Eight Ball.

423
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,930
We use real names around here.

424
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,900
Could I talk to you for a minute?

425
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,500
I asked you to get me a hacker.

426
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
She is one of the best hackers on the East Coast.

427
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,640
- Oh, I'm honored... - She has other clients.

428
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,940
They don't know her real name either.

429
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,510
I'm sorry, "Other clients"?

430
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,880
- Now? - Yeah.

431
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,810
Did you tell her what her cut was?

432
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,950
- Of course. - And?

433
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,960
Look. She's smoking!

434
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,700
So, Nine Ball.

435
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,460
Uh, do I call you Nine Ball? Nine...

436
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,100
Or Baller.

437
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,170
Baller? Okay. Okay.

438
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,640
You know your footprint is a disaster, right?

439
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,810
- I'm sorry, what? - Your footprint.

440
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,150
- My footprint? - Yes, ma'am.

441
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,620
If you're planning to steal shit,

442
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,120
you definitely got to clean this up,

443
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,150
'cause right now, my little sister could hack you.

444
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,890
Oh, right. 'Cause we had this guy...

445
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,860
Gotcha.

446
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,130
We'll clean that up.

447
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,840
- Can I ask where we're going? - You'll see in a minute.

448
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,370
Right, we're going to meet

449
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,610
- Doris Kluger... - Daphne.

450
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,110
- Daphne. - Someone even more famous.

451
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,110
Someone who makes Daphne Kluger jealous.

452
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,760
Jealous?

453
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,650
In a minute, we're gonna stand up.

454
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,920
She's gonna sit down.

455
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,650
You'll recognize her. Just be cool.

456
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,950
- Aloof. - But kind.

457
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,120
- But not too kind. - Yeah.

458
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,160
You're sweating.

459
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,020
- Yeah, look, I sweat. - Don't.

460
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,260
On her left hand is a tattoo.

461
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,600
I want you to take it, admire it,

462
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,500
but make physical contact, and that's when we'll get it.

463
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,100
"It"? What's "It"?

464
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,780
Oh, I know you!

465
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,650
Yes, I know you. I've seen you. I've seen you in things.

466
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,250
Yeah.

467
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,750
- No, you're good. - Oh, thank you.

468
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,050
- You're really good. Yeah. - Thank you.

469
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,550
Well, I just really wanted to say, "Thank you."

470
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,990
Thank you?

471
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,030
For helping us with the feline rescue project.

473
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,860
Penelope Stern?

474
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:19,100
Is she even old enough to go to the Met Ball?

475
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,370
Apparently.

476
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,970
Who cares who's dressing her anyway?

477
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,870
Uh, I think Page Six.

479
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,250
I never met with Rose Weil. You said I met with everybody.

480
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,120
- You said she was a relic. - I meant iconic.

481
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,390
Do you want me to set up a meeting?

482
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,020
- Yes! - Okay.

483
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,490
I watched one of her films last night.

484
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,030
She's actually really good.

485
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,900
Whatever you do, don't fawn.

486
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,270
Just ignore her.

487
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,770
Indifference, it's an aphrodisiac.

488
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:54,970
Very little eye contact.

489
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,930
Rose.

490
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,610
- Daphne. Miss Kluger. - Finally.

491
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,610
So, thank you so much for meeting me so last minute.

492
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:07,120
I am such an admirer of yours. I have so many of your pieces.

493
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,590
- Really? - Yeah.

494
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,790
So, this search... It has not been easy.

495
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,290
And everything we've seen,

496
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:18,560
you know, it's been great.

497
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,190
But it's been tired

498
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,100
and you just seem different.

499
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,370
You know, like you're immune to judgment.

500
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,040
Like you're above all that.

501
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
I'm sorry, what?

502
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,310
What is going on?

503
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,120
Oh, sorry.

504
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,320
Um, what were you saying?

506
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,520
I'm trying to hire you for the Met Ball.

507
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,100
Great. Thank you. My honor.

508
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,060
Flattered.

509
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,130
Wait till you see.

510
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,370
This girl has some of the best hands I've ever seen.

511
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,300
Is this one sane?

512
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,140
Hundred percent.

513
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,570
All right, here's how we're playing.

514
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,910
Red is money, okay?

515
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,280
Really? Three-card Monte?

516
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,210
Follow the Queen, live your dream.

517
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,580
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

518
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,450
'Cause she might disappear, you saw that?

519
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,590
It's lit, right?

520
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,290
She came back, though. She likes you.

521
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,360
All right, let's hit it. And we're following the Queen.

522
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,160
And we're following the Queen.

523
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,430
Is this our only choice?

524
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,360
The turnover in pickpockets is huge.

525
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,870
Where she at? Where that bitch at?

526
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,200
Where she at?

527
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
That one.

528
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,770
Wanna call a lifeline on that one?

529
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,610
No. That one.

530
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,910
All right. That one is mine.

531
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,710
Come on, there's no hard feelings.

532
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,980
And you're a real one, you know? You know what I mean?

533
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,750
Yeah, come back any time.

534
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,490
- Not bad. - Yeah. I thought so.

535
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,060
Turkey and provolone, please.

536
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,260
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

537
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,490
It's a very nice necklace.

538
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,070
Uh, lettuce and tomato.

539
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,870
- And this is legit, the money? - Hundred percent.

540
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,540
- Okay, I'm in. - Great.

541
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,980
Uh, can I get my watch back, please?

542
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,590
Thank you. And hers as well.

543
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,190
No, I...

544
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,290
- Sorry. - It's okay.

545
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,290
Who do we have, who do we have?

546
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,130
- What about Ivy? - No, still in jail.

547
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,830
- Really? - What about him?

548
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,000
- Well, he's a him. - So?

549
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,300
Don't want a him.

550
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,200
Because it's a him or because it's a "Him"?

551
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
No, he's not a "Him."

552
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,170
- I barely know the guy. - What's wrong with a him?

553
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,610
A him gets noticed, a her gets ignored,

554
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,740
and for once, we wanna be ignored.

555
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,140
What about Tammy?

556
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,830
Hey, buddy,

557
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,330
can you do me a favor? Can you take that outside?

558
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,410
Debbie, I am with my family.

559
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,680
- I told you... - I'm outside.

560
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,840
- What? - I'm in your garage.

561
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,250
Deb?

562
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,790
Deb, what are you doing here? I thought you were in jail.

563
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,160
Mmm. I got out.

564
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,600
Look at all this. Thought you retired?

565
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,560
I did.

566
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,230
Not as exciting as hijacking trucks

567
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,370
that are smuggling dishwashers from Canada, right?

568
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,140
Yeah, well, I don't do that anymore.

569
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,440
But you were so very good at it.

570
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,270
- Thank you. - Yeah.

571
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,410
So these are all for personal use, right?

572
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,080
- What do you want? - Just wanna reconnect.

573
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,140
Reconnect?

574
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,050
You're not bored out here, are you, Tam-Tam?

575
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,050
No, I'm not bored out here at all.

576
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,720
- Good, good. - No.

577
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,390
- Why would you ask that? - Because I need a fence.

578
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,500
Well, I told you I don't do that anymore. I'm out.

579
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,260
- It's a big job. - I don't care.

580
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,700
Do you want me to tell you how big a job it is?

581
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,330
No. No, I really don't.

582
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,500
I think I'm gonna tell you how big the job is.

583
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,310
- Are you kidding? - No.

584
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,550
- Mommy, when's dinner ready? - Shit!

585
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,680
Uh, sweetheart, I will be right there.

586
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,950
I'm so sorry. Mommy will be right there.

587
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,750
But I'm hungry!

588
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,320
I know, sweetheart, I promise, I will be right there.

589
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,360
- Thanks a lot. - She sounds sweet.

590
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,170
How do you explain all this to your husband?

591
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,340
eBay.

592
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,530
Okay, everybody. Let's get started.

594
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,900
We would like to present to you all

595
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,640
with a hypothetical situation.

596
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,580
- How hypothetical? - Not very, unless we screw up.

597
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,610
$16.5 million in each of your bank accounts,

598
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,210
five weeks from now.

599
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,020
In three and a half weeks,

600
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,750
the Met will be hosting its annual ball,

601
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,250
celebrating its new costume exhibit,

602
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,860
and we are going to rob it.

603
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,590
Not the ball itself,

604
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,390
but a very important set of diamonds

605
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,530
that will be attending the ball.

606
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,300
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

607
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,700
Who Rose will be dressing.

608
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,470
- The Toussaint? - Very good.

609
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,700
Once Daphne is inadvertently onboard,

610
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,000
we can then get the necklace out of the Cartier vault,

611
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,940
hack the Met security system, thank you, Nine Ball,

612
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,410
and infiltrate the Gala,

613
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,450
considered to be one of the most exclusive...

614
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,480
The most exclusive.

615
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
The most exclusive party invitation in America.

616
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,220
So go home, get your affairs in order,

617
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,290
because tomorrow, we begin pulling off

618
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,860
one of the biggest jewelry heists in history.

619
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,370
- Where are you going? - I'm going to the big city.

620
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,840
- How long? - Uh, not too long, I promise.

621
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,750
I'll be back before you know it.

622
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,350
What are you gonna do?

623
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,810
I am going to help my friend Debbie with her job.

624
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,450
What kind of job?

625
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,590
- It's complicated. - Can I come with you?

626
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,290
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's very special work trip.

627
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,530
It is my account, it is my money,

628
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,990
and the only reason I can't access it

629
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,860
is because I cannot remember the make and model

630
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,530
of my second cousin's first car.

631
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,600
So if you could just...

632
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,400
I don't wanna make a withdrawal,

633
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,640
I would like to make a deposit.

634
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,140
Yes, I...

635
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,970
Hey, can I...

636
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,510
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold. What's up?

637
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,520
Oh, hey, I was wondering if I can get a MetroCard,

638
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,850
'cause I'm skateboarding in from Queens every day.

639
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,290
Can I get a MetroCard?

640
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,990
I don't have a MetroCard.

641
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,260
You don't have a MetroCard?

642
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,490
I don't have a MetroCard.

643
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,160
What are you, a tourist?

644
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,630
You're fascinating.

645
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,100
You're gonna just throw me one dub

646
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,500
for a MetroCard? That's it?

647
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,900
How about this? We steal $50 million,

648
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,310
I'll buy everybody MetroCards. How's that?

649
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,510
Okay.

650
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,310
- Is that your brother? - Mmm-hmm.

651
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,710
- He's hot. - Mmm.

652
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,280
You sure he's dead or...

653
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,520
No.

654
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,190
Yes, sweetie, Mommy is in her new job now.

655
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,260
Charlie, will you do me a favor?

656
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,930
Can you put that right there?

657
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,830
What, sweetheart?

658
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,500
Um, uh, well... Mommy...

659
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,400
finds very special toys,

660
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,730
and then she finds new homes for them.

661
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,640
Yes, exactly like your turtle. That is exactly right.

662
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,410
Thank you so much, Charlie, thank you.

663
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,810
Sweetheart, I have to go.

664
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,540
I just got a brand new toy for Debbie,

665
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,210
and I can't wait to play with it.

666
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,530
Zirconium.

667
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,060
- I like it. - Yeah, I bet you do.

668
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,230
Unhand the man.

669
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,400
Thank you very much.

670
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,870
Here are your very special glasses.

671
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:53,770
If Rose can pull this off, and that is a very big "If",

672
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,210
these glasses will scan the real necklace

673
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:59,410
and send a digital print back to us here.

674
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:01,050
Once we have that,

675
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,380
this thing will print

676
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,450
a replica of the necklace in zirconium.

678
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,420
- Where is it? - These are not the Toussaint.

679
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,280
We thought you might want to see these first.

680
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,690
Right. What for?

681
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:45,390
There are certain logistical problems with that necklace.

682
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:47,330
We wouldn't even know how to insure it.

683
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,060
All right.

684
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,460
"We were very clear on the phone."

685
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,830
Yes. We were very clear on the phone.

686
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,000
We are only interested in the Toussaint.

687
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,440
Yeah.

688
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,880
Well, then, that would have to be a much longer discussion.

689
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,880
That necklace is valued at over $150 million.

690
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,420
Well, I'm not really a numbers person.

691
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,090
It would require its own security team,

692
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,560
a new insurance policy.

693
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,730
I'm sure you'll work out all those details.

694
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:22,160
Oh, it's not that simple.

695
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,800
I'm afraid the answer is no.

696
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,370
No?

697
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,970
No.

698
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,110
Look, can I be frank?

699
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,810
I have always loved Cartier.

700
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,950
I think, historically, this has been

701
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,550
the most significant house in the world.

702
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,320
But there is whole generation out there

703
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,060
who mispronounce your name.

704
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,020
French can be difficult.

713
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,550
Oui.

715
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,910
Stop it.

716
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,680
- Stop it. That doesn't help. Stop. - Okay, all right. All right.

717
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,720
We're too far underground. Can't get a signal.

718
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,530
Very secure down here, huh?

719
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,760
Five feet of solid concrete.

720
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,240
You said you wanted to see it in the light.

721
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,370
You wanted to see the necklace in the light.

722
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,580
Right!

723
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,940
This is light.

724
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,250
No, no, no, she means real light. Natural light, yes.

725
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,980
The red carpet happens while the sun is still out.

726
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,020
Yes, no,

727
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,350
- I'm afraid that's vital. - It's vital.

728
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,890
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

729
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,990
She must have the sun.

730
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,600
- How is this light, Ms. Weil? - Um...

731
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,740
Yes, I think, yes, we have the sun.

732
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,070
Much better.

734
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,010
- There it is! - All right.

735
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,080
Hello, sexy.

736
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,600
Come on, come on.

737
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,100
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

738
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,740
- She's fine. - Hmm.

739
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,370
She needs to take it in.

740
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,680
This is her process.

741
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,450
It looks really good.

742
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,120
- It's so clear. - Yeah.

743
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,720
Come on.

744
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,020
No, okay. You gotta...

745
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,160
No. Yep.

746
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,560
If you are done, Ms. Weil...

747
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,600
...we'd like to...

748
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,730
...return this to the vault.

749
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,930
Ms. Weil?

750
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Ms. Weil.

751
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,710
Yes!

752
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,040
I'm done.

753
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,680
Sweet.

754
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,090
Oh, my God!

755
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,000
- Well? - I don't know.

756
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:59,040
Well, you don't know because this is only a muslin.

757
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,810
It's going to be pink, for a start.

758
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,780
I know it's going to be pink, but I don't know.

759
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,210
Yeah, I feel like it's the waist.

760
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,450
I feel, like, it's just... And then the bottom.

761
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,780
I don't know about the bottom.

762
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,110
We can definitely change the hem.

763
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,520
- It's the necklace. - Oh, no.

764
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,580
- It's not the necklace. - It is the necklace.

765
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,390
It's just messy.

766
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,550
No, no, no, it's not messy.

767
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,260
It's messy 'cause it's safety pins.

768
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,790
No, you must remember the diamonds.

769
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,260
It's gonna be diamonds.

770
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,930
I just feel like I look huge.

771
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,360
Hey, Daphne, come here. Come here. Come here.

772
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,870
Listen, deep breath... Deep breath.

773
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,000
Listen, look.

774
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,810
You've got one of the greatest necks in the world.

775
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,310
In fact, you've got the only neck

776
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:39,310
that could carry this necklace off.

777
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,220
With your neck, this necklace...

778
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,920
You are gonna walk into that Met Gala, and you

779
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,190
you are gonna light up the sky.

780
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,430
Thank you.

781
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,230
You're welcome.

782
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,600
If you like him, you go right,

783
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,800
and if you don't...

784
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,070
- I go left. - Yeah, you go left.

785
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,470
- So... - Okay, that sounds easy.

786
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,180
- So do you like him? - Ooh. I like him a lot.

787
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,510
Okay, why?

788
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,880
He looks kind.

789
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,310
I'm gonna swipe right.

790
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,380
- Okay. All right. - Oh, my God!

792
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,650
So does that mean...

793
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,990
He liked you back! He likes you, too!

794
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,150
What happens now? What happens now?

795
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,090
- So you can message him. - Okay.

796
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,990
And you can say, maybe, like, the eggplant emoji,

797
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,060
or maybe the girl that does this.

798
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,050
Excuse me.

799
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,510
Can you help me with something?

800
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,580
I think I'm a little lost.

801
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,820
Of course, ma'am.

802
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,120
I feel like I'm going in circles.

803
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,750
I came from Egypt back there,

804
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,490
and I'm trying to get to Oceana.

805
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,620
It's a little confusing.

806
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,120
You can go down the stairs to your right,

807
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,190
or you can go back where you came from,

808
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,420
- right down there. - Okay.

809
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,760
It might take a little bit longer.

810
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,460
Excuse me, ma'am.

811
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

812
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,880
Here's one for your morning commute.

813
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,950
Last night, political artist Banksy

814
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,190
made a surprise contribution to the Met.

815
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,460
Our founding mothers

816
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,030
appeared at the Met last night.

817
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,330
Traffic at 15 after the hour.

818
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:08,560
Your news, all the time.

820
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,760
This is a major security breach.

821
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,970
How is this even possible?

822
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,440
He did it at the Tate, too.

823
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,700
So you're saying

824
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,540
the system your company designed for our museum

825
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,880
does nothing to prevent someone like Banksy...

826
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,340
Sir, we're a little more focused

827
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,850
on keeping things in than keeping things out.

829
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:37,430
Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?

830
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,190
Correct me if I'm wrong.

831
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,920
You and your company are responsible

832
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,020
for monitoring and safeguarding...

833
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,160
Hey, want me to get the trash?

834
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,990
What? No.

835
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,760
You sure? 'Cause you got a lot here, buddy.

836
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,070
Fine. Just hurry it up.

837
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,570
The museum's agreement

838
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,270
with your father's company is very...

839
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,210
- Generous. - Specific.

840
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,670
Have a nice night.

841
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:30,240
The board expects McCallister Security

842
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,710
to live up to the letter of that agreement.

843
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,710
We'll do a full audit of the system

844
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,750
and update any part of it that needs to be changed.

845
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,190
What does that mean?

846
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,550
- We'll go in and fix it. - When?

847
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,720
Immediately.

848
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,020
So, now that we've gotten them

849
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:45,390
to make changes to their system,

850
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:47,930
we can make changes, too, and not be detected.

851
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,330
Can you pull up the cameras?

852
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:51,300
They've got every inch of this place covered.

853
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,870
But here is not where we're gonna hit it.

854
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,470
We are gonna do it in a spot they don't even care about.

855
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,470
Nine Ball.

856
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,310
Now it's a New York State law

857
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,540
that no cameras can be mounted in a public bathroom.

858
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,980
Apparently, it's a privacy violation.

859
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,210
Unless you're into that.

860
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,550
And once we get the Toussaint,

861
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,680
we are gonna have to get it out of there

862
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,610
without being detected,

863
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:10,850
and they're gonna go over

864
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,350
their security footage with a fine-tooth comb,

865
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,090
and anyone seen exiting that bathroom

866
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,290
is gonna be a suspect.

867
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:17,960
So...

868
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
So we get a mule.

869
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,360
Somebody else is gonna move it for us.

870
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,100
How much space do you need outside

871
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,200
that bathroom to plant it on somebody?

872
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,570
I don't know. Nine feet?

873
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,070
And how long is it gonna take us

874
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,740
to build a nine-foot blind spot?

875
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,270
- Moving a camera? - Mmm-hmm.

876
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,550
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

877
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,650
Great.

878
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,880
How long did it take you to figure all this out?

879
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,090
Five years, eight months, and 12 days.

880
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,760
Give or take.

881
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,060
Cartier has hired

882
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,000
the best private security in the world.

883
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,030
Guillermo DeVita

884
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,030
led the pope's security for 10 years.

885
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,170
And as you know, they've never lost a pope.

886
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,570
- Mmm. - Yuri Eshel, former Mossad

887
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,240
and IDF Special Forces, elite commando unit.

888
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,510
I'm pretty sure they're assassins.

889
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,980
- Well, it's a nice necklace. - Yeah.

890
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,180
So you can go ahead and just add them to your list.

891
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,020
- What list? - That list.

892
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,620
It's not a list.

898
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,080
Okay. Who is he?

902
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,760
Oh, Paul.

909
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,210
You poor thing.

910
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,820
Look at that.

912
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,400
We don't even know if it is Banksy.

913
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,770
It could be an imitator.

918
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,260
That's all you got?

920
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,280
Sweet!

922
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,600
Good afternoon. Vogue.

923
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,640
Thank you for coming in so last minute.

924
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,470
Oh, of course. Thank you for having me.

925
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:28,440
I guess you heard, we lost one of our coordinators.

926
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,080
Yes, and that sounded awful.

927
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,140
Chiggers.

928
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:32,680
I know.

929
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,910
- What are those anyway? - It's like a mite, I think.

930
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,520
It burrows into the skin and lays its eggs inside.

931
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,720
And then they hatch and they dig their way out.

932
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,960
Apparently, it can last for weeks.

933
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,660
Well, you certainly seem qualified.

934
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,590
Thank you.

935
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,930
Maybe overqualified.

936
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,130
Well, how can anyone be overqualified?

937
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,160
This is the Met Gala after all.

938
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,700
Gala. Met Gala.

939
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,770
- It's Gala. - Gala.

940
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,840
Is it Gala?

941
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,870
- Yeah. - Okay.

942
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,010
Roger Federer again

943
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,250
one game away from another championship.

944
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,280
The love for Federer in this place is just incredible.

945
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,490
Anna.

946
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,580
Uh, yeah?

947
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:14,490
You have that interview for the Met staff position.

948
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,820
- Do it, do it. - Okay.

949
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,520
You cannot be serious!

950
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,960
A backhand down-the-line win!

951
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,090
We're really short on desk space,

952
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,860
so you'll be down here.

953
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,870
This way.

954
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,470
- Okay, so here is your desk. - Thank you.

955
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:33,610
And Christina will get you started.

956
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,970
Great. Thank you so much.

957
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,110
- Have a good day! - Thanks!

958
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,410
- Excuse me. - Yes?

959
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,740
Was that the bathroom that we passed?

960
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,210
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

961
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,450
Thank you.

963
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,140
This is unbelievable.

964
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,300
That's Leo?

965
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,570
Leo-Leo?

966
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,070
There's only one Leo.

967
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,040
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

968
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,580
You're so white!

969
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,980
Can't we just go to this? Do we have to steal stuff?

970
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,280
Yes!

971
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,320
- Where is she? - Table four, 10:00.

972
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,520
Straightest shot to the bathroom

973
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,720
without putting her in Siberia.

974
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,360
There's a blank spot next to her.

976
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,690
It's for her date.

977
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,290
Who's her date?

978
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,500
I don't know.

979
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,300
- Hi. - Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt,

980
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,260
but I've got the final guest list

981
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:34,330
for the Chairman's Dinner.

982
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,700
Oh, great.

983
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,000
You have all their arrival times?

984
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,240
All their arrival times,

985
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,270
including a few additional names at the bottom.

986
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,670
Claude Becker?

987
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,240
His publicist was into it.

988
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,750
I barely had to ask.

990
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,220
Hello.

991
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,550
They put me next to you.

992
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,160
Oh, lucky me.

993
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,360
Hello.

994
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,030
Claude Becker.

995
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,060
Daphne Kluger.

996
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,510
The ego has landed.

997
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,580
How did you ever fall for this schmuck?

998
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,480
Seriously?

999
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,490
Lou and I were going through a rough patch,

1000
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:30,290
and I really wanted a big score of my own.

1001
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:31,620
So he roped you in?

1002
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,860
Mmm. Not really.

1003
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,160
What, told you the truth?

1004
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,030
Only way to con a con, right?

1006
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,510
B1
B1.

1007
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,880
Lou and I were rigging Bingo

1008
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,510
and running cheap cons at Roulette.

1009
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,720
Lucky if we made $1,000 a night.

1010
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,020
- Bingo! - Bingo call.

1011
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,190
So a friend of mine set me up with this art dealer

1012
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:04,160
and we worked out a simple little hustle.

1013
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,920
- Claude Becker? - Right through there.

1014
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,090
Thank you.

1015
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:09,560
Hi. I'm Debbie.

1016
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,830
Claude Becker.

1017
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,730
When somebody got interested in a piece,

1018
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,740
I'd pose as another buyer and drive up the price.

1019
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,680
Money was good and he was great in the kitchen.

1020
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,150
Oh, my God, it's so good.

1021
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,450
One day

1022
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,490
he asked me to pose as the seller, not the buyer.

1023
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,190
What did you do?

1024
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:35,790
Well...

1025
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,060
One signature, half a million dollars.

1026
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,530
He said it was simple.

1027
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,370
I'd hand them the documents, and they'd slide me a check.

1028
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:54,880
The whole thing would take a couple minutes, tops.

1029
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,320
Sorry we're late.

1030
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,850
- Not at all. - It's okay.

1031
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:08,220
- Very nice to meet you. - It's a pleasure.

1032
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,060
- It's a beautiful piece. - Oh, we just love it!

1033
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:15,190
He was right. It all happened very quickly.

1034
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,660
You have a right to an attorney.

1035
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,330
If you cannot afford an attorney...

1036
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,470
It wasn't my painting. She brought the picture to me.

1037
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,530
She had documentation, signatures.

1038
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,100
And you two were dating?

1039
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:26,470
What?

1040
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,670
Not saying a word.

1041
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:29,940
Are you sure?

1042
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:35,950
'Cause he's not being quite as tight-lipped as you are.

1043
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,920
Are these your signatures?

1044
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,760
Yeah, I will testify.

1045
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,290
I was defrauded too, right?

1046
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:47,790
I'll be right outside.

1047
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,260
We need to talk.

1048
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,460
You better tell me this is not what I think this is.

1049
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:26,570
What?

1050
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,040
Claude Becker.

1051
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,940
I didn't do that.

1052
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,700
I'm not a croupier, okay?

1053
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,410
Or a tourist with a bucket of quarters.

1054
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,770
Don't con me.

1055
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,940
You do not run a job in a job!

1056
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,680
It's not going to matter.

1057
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,180
We are going to get caught.

1058
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,350
Stop it. We're not.

1059
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,620
Why do you do this?

1060
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,050
Why can't you just do a job?

1061
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,960
Why does there always have to be an asterisk?

1062
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:54,990
You frame him, I walk.

1063
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,100
Stop.

1064
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,660
This is just like last time.

1065
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:00,000
Lou. Lou!

1066
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,400
Lou.

1067
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,770
He sent me to jail!

1068
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,110
You have no idea what that's like.

1069
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:15,480
Yeah, well, he's gonna do it again.

1070
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,190
No, he's not.

1071
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,290
He's not.

1072
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,270
Good. Switching cameras.

1073
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,250
Walking towards the bathroom.

1074
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,190
Okay, in the blind spot.

1075
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,390
I'm gonna keep walking.

1076
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,220
Nothin'.

1077
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,660
Nothin'.

1078
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:04,300
Okay, you're right there.

1079
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,710
12 feet. Nice job!

1080
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,510
Thank you, Nine Ball.

1081
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,350
That easy. Don't mention it.

1082
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,380
What's hard?

1083
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,560
Sorry, listen, I know this really

1084
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,860
isn't any of my business...

1085
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,020
No, go ahead.

1086
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,560
It's just a little red flag here.

1087
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,900
But this caterer doesn't have a nutritional specialist.

1088
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,400
- Okay. - And we're running

1089
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,530
at 20% special meals.

1090
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:42,570
Vegan, gluten-free, low sodium, lactose.

1091
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,600
I had a client get sued.

1092
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,040
- Really? - Yeah.

1093
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,710
I don't think we should wing any of this stuff.

1094
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,610
I think we are short a staff person.

1095
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:50,940
We need a nutritionist.

1096
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,610
- I do know someone. - You do?

1097
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,880
Yeah, and she's great.

1098
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,450
She just moved here from Australia.

1099
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,550
Yes.

1100
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,090
Okay. Go.

1101
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,420
Vendor, hallway, hallway.

1102
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,390
Past the auditorium.

1103
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,130
Hallway, hallway, hallway, entry.

1104
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,200
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late. Traffic was horrible.

1105
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,770
Okay...

1106
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:18,800
- Amita. - Thank you.

1107
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,340
Constance.

1108
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,840
Nine Ball.

1109
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,950
And Lou.

1110
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,850
And Rose.

1111
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:29,250
Thank you.

1112
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,750
- And Debbie. - Thank you.

1113
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,320
Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,

1114
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,460
and this is your sneak peek of this year's Costume Institute.

1115
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,760
This is Dolce and that's Galliano for Dior.

1116
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,760
And that is McQueen.

1117
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,300
And who's dressing you tomorrow?

1118
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,600
Mmm. Rose Weil.

1119
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,030
- Interesting. - I know.

1120
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,740
I kind of thought it was an unexpected choice.

1121
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,940
What's this over here?

1122
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,070
So these are the crown jewels from eight royal families of Europe.

1123
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,580
Which is probably why there's a moat.

1124
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,050
- So we can't go over there? - No. God, no.

1125
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,820
I wish we could. Anyway...

1126
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,350
Uh, they are on loan to us from Dmitri

1127
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:08,050
Very-Long-Russian-Last-Name that I can't pronounce.

1128
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,750
We hear those aren't the only jewels

1129
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,890
that'll be on display.

1130
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:12,620
- Who told you? - I have sources.

1131
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,930
Well, since the cat's already out of the bag...

1132
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,930
Yes, I will be wearing a necklace

1133
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,070
that Cartier has decided to loan me.

1134
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,400
It's called the Toussaint,

1135
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,230
and it has been in a vault for 50 years.

1136
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:25,200
And I'm just a little excited.

1137
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:27,410
- Have you tried it on already? - Maybe.

1138
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,180
- How many carats is it? - Enough.

1140
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,150
Lipstick. What do you think?

1141
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:18,460
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

1142
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,460
In a good way.

1143
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,530
Thank you.

1144
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:29,930
- It's here. - Right. Finally. Great.

1145
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,370
All right.

1146
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,210
- Oh, you haven't seen it. - No.

1147
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,940
- Hello. - Hello.

1148
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,220
Ooh. That's a big box.

1149
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,360
All right.

1150
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,400
Holy crap!

1151
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:00,470
Should we, uh...

1152
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,770
Let's try it on. See if it fits.

1153
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:02,900
Okay.

1154
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,940
- Can I, uh... - Sure.

1155
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,710
Wow. That's heavy.

1156
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,880
Really heavy.

1157
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,110
Come to mama.

1158
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,680
All right. It might be a little...

1159
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,150
Just a tad cold. Right.

1160
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:25,820
All right. Okay.

1161
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,930
Let me see. Right.

1162
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:30,530
That goes in.

1163
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:31,900
Look at you.

1164
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,600
Yep. There.

1165
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:35,100
It fits.

1166
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,140
All right.

1167
01:01:38,970 --> 01:01:40,370
It fits.

1168
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,440
Right, okay.

1169
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,980
We can get it off, and then we can try the frock.

1170
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,110
- Okay. - Um... Hang on.

1171
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,720
Sorry, you cannot do it. I have to do it.

1172
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:53,150
It requires a special magnet.

1173
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:55,250
- What? - Cool.

1174
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,890
- Uh, special magnet? - Yes.

1175
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:03,760
That's cool.

1176
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,000
That's brilliant. Brilliant.

1177
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,670
Amazing.

1178
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:10,670
Can I, uh...

1179
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,270
Can I just see that again, out of interest?

1180
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,680
- Sure. - Thanks.

1181
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:19,580
That's amazing.

1182
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:24,850
Great. Let me just see. So how does it work?

1183
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,190
Hilda Schneider, fashion reporter, Der Spiegel.

1184
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:27,390
No.

1185
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,590
Hilda Schneider, diplomatic attache?

1186
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,490
No.

1187
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:30,790
- Lufthansa asset? - Lufthansa.

1188
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,020
Problem.

1189
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,590
- With? - From Rose.

1190
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,730
Oh, God.

1191
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,030
Come on!

1192
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:40,430
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

1193
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:41,870
And you can only do it with a magnet?

1194
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:43,840
- Only the magnet. - Let me just see...

1195
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,300
Stop. Play it again.

1196
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,110
Oh, my God, that is amazing.

1197
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:49,570
And you can only do it with a magnet?

1198
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,780
- Only the magnet. - Zoom in a little bit.

1199
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,590
What, Leslie? I'm busy.

1200
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,530
Leslie?

1201
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:11,800
Hey, sis, we're in a bit of a jam right now,

1202
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,100
and I need your help.

1203
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:19,470
So it seems like they used poly-magnets and a spring.

1204
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,510
It gives you attraction and repulsion

1205
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,410
in the same axis, you know?

1206
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:26,240
- Not really. - Well, they're drawn together.

1207
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,310
But don't touch, until you rotate it,

1208
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,080
and then they lock.

1209
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:33,690
It's real dope. I'll go get you a positive

1210
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:37,460
and a negative pole in a loop. That oughta work fine.

1211
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,460
You're a little genius, sis. Thank you.

1212
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,060
Really? She fixed it?

1213
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,830
Really? You just asked me that?

1214
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,210
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

1215
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,680
- Nine Ball. - Check.

1216
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,110
- Debbie. - Check.

1217
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:04,110
- Constance. - Yeah.

1218
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,320
- Amita. - Yep.

1219
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,090
- Lou. - Check.

1220
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,940
That shit was hectic. Got chased by a cop!

1221
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,640
Okay, so this is my sister, everyone, Veronica.

1222
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,510
Check this out. Crazy.

1223
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,920
Tight. All right. I owe you one, you little shit.

1224
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,620
Just get me a new ID.

1225
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,250
Go home.

1226
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,120
What do your parents do?

1227
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,730
Okay, we are up. Is everybody on?

1228
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:49,230
Yes.

1229
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,430
All right, ladies. Half an hour.

1230
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,570
Countdown starting now.

1231
01:04:55,840 --> 01:05:00,810
Okay. First. No need to be nervous.

1232
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,110
The food is better on the inside

1233
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:03,410
than most people think

1234
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:06,340
and even solitary can be kind of peaceful.

1235
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:17,490
I just wanna say, thank you.

1236
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:22,730
The last three weeks have been amazing for me,

1237
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,570
and we've all worked very hard for this moment.

1238
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,370
So whatever happens tonight,

1239
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,800
I want you to remember one thing,

1240
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,470
you are not doing this for me.

1241
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,410
You are not doing this for you.

1242
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:39,540
Somewhere out there is an eight-year-old girl

1243
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,620
lying in bed, dreaming of being a criminal.

1244
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:47,920
Let's do this for her.

1245
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,720
Do not engage in informal conversation with the guests, please.

1246
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,630
Do not have your cell phone on you.

1247
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,030
Please make sure your cell phone is turned in

1248
01:05:55,030 --> 01:05:57,060
to security prior to the start of the event.

1249
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,260
Very important.

1250
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,130
Do not slouch, cross your arms,

1251
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,430
put your hands in your pockets.

1252
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:02,530
I know it's gonna be a long night.

1253
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:04,600
I know you're gonna get tired.

1254
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,420
- Hello. - Hello. How are you?

1255
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,950
Edward, so good to see you. Claude Becker.

1256
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:26,360
- Pleasure. - And, of course, Rose Weil.

1257
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,230
- You two know each other? - Yes.

1258
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:30,430
My dear, is that the Toussaint?

1259
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:32,200
I'd say you look like a million bucks,

1260
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,730
but it's more like 100 million.

1261
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:36,700
Thank you, it's a 150 million actually.

1262
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,370
What inspired you for tonight's look?

1263
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:43,340
Her.

1264
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:03,760
Unreal. So what makes this such a fun night?

1265
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,500
I mean, you never know who you're gonna see.

1266
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,100
It's stars from all over the planet.

1267
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:11,370
Meeting actors, people in the fashion industry.

1268
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:15,540
So coming up next, we have Serena Williams.

1269
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:18,080
- How are you? - I'm good. How are you?

1270
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,740
I'm good, thank you.

1271
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,280
So you've conquered the court, you've conquered motherhood...

1272
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,680
- I'm trying. - I mean, you are succeeding.

1273
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,550
Sorry, we're a little backed up today. Your name?

1274
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,390
Uh, Hilda Schneider.

1275
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:31,290
Oh, here it is. Have a good night.

1279
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:41,900
Here, Heidi! Heidi!

1280
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,670
Yes. Ready for tonight?

1281
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,010
- Hi, how are you? - Nice to see you! Fantastic.

1282
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Ready to sit.

1283
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,810
- Hot sauce? - Hot sauce.

1284
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:28,510
- You good? - Yeah. I'll see you soon?

1285
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,510
Hey, no, we're closed.

1286
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,480
We're closed.

1287
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,950
Come on, dude. It's right there.

1288
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,560
Yeah, I got her.

1289
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,930
Yeah, I see her.

1290
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,930
We're a go.

1291
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,540
Hi, everybody.

1292
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,070
- Hi. - How are you?

1293
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,670
Hi. Good to see you.

1294
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,870
It's so good to see you. You look amazing.

1295
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,180
- You too. Cheers. - Oh, yeah, cheers.

1296
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,520
No, no, these are real.

1297
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,490
Thank you very much. So kind of you.

1298
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,100
Okay, counting down.

1299
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:30,640
Three, two, one.

1300
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,770
Need a gluten-free

1301
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,970
and a broiled fish for Table Eight.

1302
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,640
Where's the vegan for Table Four?

1303
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,480
Over here.

1304
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,220
Go, go, go.

1305
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,640
Oh, God!

1306
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,520
I'm so hungry.

1307
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:21,420
Mmm. I haven't eaten anything in three days.

1308
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,660
I'm sorry.

1309
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,130
Am I being rude?

1310
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,790
She's in deep.

1311
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,570
Maybe half a bowl.

1312
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,180
So, you're supposed to curtsy.

1313
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,290
They actually have a guy there to teach you how to curtsy.

1314
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:55,750
Yes, that's true.

1315
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,720
Anyway, I go in, I'm doing this little knee bend.

1316
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,590
And the Queen glares at me

1317
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,260
and says, "That's not a curtsy."

1318
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:03,230
Really?

1319
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,300
So now, I am in a curtsy standoff

1320
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,600
with the Queen of England.

1321
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,800
And...

1322
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,240
Are you okay?

1323
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,810
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just...

1324
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:16,210
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

1325
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,780
- No! I'm fine. - Are you sure?

1326
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,380
I'm at this curtsy standoff with Queen...

1327
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:23,910
- And she's... - Are you okay?

1328
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,480
I'm fine. Just give me one second,

1329
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,690
hold on. I just need to get this...

1330
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,090
You all right?

1331
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:46,010
Game on!

1332
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,020
Excuse me, we need to...

1333
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,000
That's good.

1334
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,700
Okay, you're right on the edge of the blind spot.

1335
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:20,570
Hey, you all right?

1336
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,240
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

1337
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,640
It's okay. You'll be okay. Breathe, breathe...

1338
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,010
Breathe... Breathe...

1339
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:30,310
Breathe.

1340
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,850
Okay, ten seconds.

1341
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,260
Here we go.

1342
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,620
Hey, come here.

1343
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:40,860
This can't be here. You need to

1344
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,130
get this into the kitchen right away.

1345
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,460
- No problem. - Okay, go. Go, go.

1346
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:45,660
Coming at you, Deb.

1347
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,430
Okay, here he comes.

1348
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,880
Okay, my mule is out.

1349
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,120
All my ladies still in the dark.

1350
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,260
Dude. Dude.

1351
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:13,230
- You have it? - Have what?

1352
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:15,590
Oh, I smoked it.

1353
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,830
What do you mean, "Smoked it"?

1354
01:14:16,830 --> 01:14:18,060
You know, Josh asked,

1355
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,800
and he was like, "Hey, do you have..."

1356
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,800
Guys, where is he? What's wrong?

1357
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:23,770
What's happening?

1358
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:26,540
Stalled in the hallway. Chitchattin'.

1359
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,110
Tammy, you got to get him moving now.

1360
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,150
I'm putting the soup down, I'm like...

1361
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:39,580
Hey! Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?

1362
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:40,880
You're not getting paid to talk.

1363
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,960
- Let's go, come on. - Yeah, sorry.

1364
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,940
Here, I'll take those. I'll take those.

1365
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,380
Thanks.

1366
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,960
Bathroom break. Bathroom break!

1367
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,030
That was intense.

1368
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,430
What?

1369
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,380
I don't know. It could've fallen off in there.

1370
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,850
It could've fallen off back there. I'm not sure.

1371
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:20,420
I was just barfing my guts out.

1372
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:23,120
I was back at the table the whole time.

1373
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:24,960
Seal the exits.

1374
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,220
What? No. Do we have to make

1375
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:27,590
such a big deal about this? Come on.

1376
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:30,430
- You better lock it up. - Oh, come on!

1377
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,600
- We need to clear the room. - You can't do that.

1378
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,430
We need to do a full sweep.

1379
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:35,930
We can't.

1380
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,630
Do you know who's here?

1381
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:39,700
You just lost $150 million.

1382
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:42,610
What would you do if it was a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

1383
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,210
Dinner will resume shortly, I promise!

1384
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,010
Thank you so much for your understanding.

1385
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,920
Just walk towards the stairs.

1386
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,750
Sealin' the exits.

1387
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,020
Gentlemen, we're working in teams of two.

1388
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:01,120
We start at the perimeter and work our way in.

1389
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,430
Once you've been scanned,

1390
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:04,700
please go directly to the exit.

1391
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,860
There will be someone there

1392
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,000
that will show you where to go.

1393
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,170
Do you know what's going on here?

1394
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:19,280
An item seems to have been lost.

1395
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:20,580
They're looking for it now.

1396
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,580
- Do you know what they lost? - Diamonds.

1397
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:24,620
Lots of diamonds.

1398
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,280
Diamonds? Really? We're waiting around for diamonds?

1399
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:28,390
Sir, I really just need to go to the bathroom.

1400
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,060
Okay, shit's blowing up.

1401
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:36,690
Police coming, Cartier coming.

1402
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:38,360
A bunch of news people coming.

1403
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:40,570
Yeah.

1404
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:42,670
Yeah, they're doing it.

1405
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:44,270
They're about halfway through.

1406
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,300
Was there anything you did or anyone you talked to

1407
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,970
between your table and the bathroom?

1408
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,870
I was rather preoccupied at the time,

1409
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,480
in case you didn't notice.

1410
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,390
Amita, there's a guy in the kitchen.

1411
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:04,250
Just give it a few more minutes.

1412
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,290
We don't have a few minutes.

1413
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,500
Oh, shit!

1414
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:15,100
He's right there.

1415
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,300
Tammy, how close? Where are you now?

1416
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:17,500
By the moat.

1417
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:21,210
Tammy, pull it out of the water.

1418
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,480
Just plant it in the water! Just pull it out, right now!

1419
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,020
Found it!

1420
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,250
It was in the water. It must have fallen off

1421
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,620
while you were running.

1422
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,820
May I?

1423
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,290
We got it back.

1424
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:39,360
Okay. I'll come back down.

1425
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,400
Constance, you good.

1426
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,480
Whoa, sick!

1427
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,550
Uh-uh. There's glue, there's glue!

1428
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:23,100
Feeling better?

1429
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,440
I do now.

1430
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,470
Couple scotches, please.

1433
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,550
Dear God!

1434
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,700
Thank you.

1435
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:39,770
Very nice.

1436
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,830
First of all,

1437
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,430
I'm not a member of law enforcement.

1438
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:45,970
I work with the insurance carrier.

1439
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,800
Which means I'm either looking for fraud

1440
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:49,570
or I'm looking for the real necklace.

1441
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:51,610
Beyond that, I couldn't care less.

1442
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:54,280
I'm afraid you won't find either here.

1443
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,720
We'll see about that, Monsieur...

1444
01:22:57,820 --> 01:23:00,520
- Monsieur? - Delarue-Broussard.

1445
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,150
Okay.

1446
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:03,620
Lawrence, when did you last see

1447
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:06,160
what you believe to be the authentic item?

1448
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,830
When it left here for the Met Gala.

1449
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,560
When did you know this was a fake?

1450
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,260
The moment it was returned.

1451
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,800
And you two.

1452
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,300
You had your eyes on the necklace

1453
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,770
the entire evening?

1454
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:17,440
Apart from when Miss Kluger had her

1455
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,100
unfortunate incident in the public toilet.

1456
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,270
That's correct.

1457
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:22,170
Did you accompany her inside?

1458
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,540
It's a women's bathroom.

1459
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,840
It's a very big necklace.

1460
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,580
There is only one entrance in and out.

1461
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,980
We were stationed at the door.

1462
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,910
Did you check the plumbing?

1463
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,880
- No. - I did.

1464
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:34,350
Okay, keep going forward.

1465
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,490
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

1466
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,530
Whoever stole this necklace

1467
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,570
managed to get out without being detected.

1468
01:23:51,570 --> 01:23:54,040
Which means we're looking for someone very smart.

1469
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,500
Gentlemen.

1470
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,340
I've seen a thoroughbred racehorse

1471
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:59,540
thrown into a tree shredder.

1472
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,980
People will go to great lengths

1473
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,280
to defraud an insurance carrier.

1474
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,680
There! What's this?

1475
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,550
I'm saying that's not a blind spot.

1476
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,360
- What do you call that then? - The bathroom.

1477
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:13,690
I don't see a bathroom.

1478
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:14,660
That's...

1479
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:16,160
Because it's in the blind spot.

1480
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,630
What can someone steal from a bathroom anyway?

1481
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:20,630
I don't know, toiletries,

1482
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:22,630
mints, hand towels,

1483
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:25,940
a six-pound diamond necklace, apparently.

1484
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,040
Now, who's this?

1485
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,170
A busboy?

1486
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,310
Do you know him?

1487
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:30,680
How would I know a busboy?

1488
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,140
Aren't we posh?

1489
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,750
I don't know everyone who goes in and out of the museum.

1490
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,380
Why do you care about a busboy?

1491
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,350
He's the only person who moves in and out of the blind spot

1492
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:40,720
during the period in question.

1493
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,790
Could you please stop calling it a blind spot?

1494
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:44,690
Fine.

1495
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:47,790
The bathroom door that we can't see

1496
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:50,260
because of your unique camera placement.

1497
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:54,060
This is the most sophisticated museum security in the world.

1498
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:56,570
Every piece of art is recorded from multiple angles.

1499
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:00,240
We just don't happen to keep art in the bathroom.

1500
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:02,370
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

1501
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:04,540
I'm an insurance investigator.

1502
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,940
I didn't wanna do it.

1503
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,880
But Eric's all, like, "Come on!"

1504
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,950
I'm, like, "Dude, I don't do that anymore."

1505
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:12,480
He's, like, "Everyone's out on the loading dock!"

1506
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,550
I know it was really stupid.

1507
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:17,190
I know I'm an asshole,

1508
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,660
but it wasn't even my weed.

1509
01:25:21,030 --> 01:25:22,030
I'm sorry, what?

1510
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,660
It wasn't my weed! Do you want me

1511
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,330
to pee in a cup or something?

1512
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,660
No, that won't be necessary.

1513
01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:27,930
Are you sure? I really don't mind.

1514
01:25:27,930 --> 01:25:28,800
I'm positive.

1515
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,530
They put the necklace on me.

1516
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:32,570
Then I walked the red carpet.

1517
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:34,270
Then I saw the exhibit.

1518
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:36,210
Then I ate my soup.

1519
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,580
Then I hurled my guts out.

1520
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:38,810
Then the necklace was gone.

1521
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,610
And then everybody freaked out.

1522
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:43,710
And then they found it again, I thought.

1523
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,510
But, no?

1524
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,450
This gentleman.

1525
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:49,020
Claude Becker.

1526
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:52,520
He was my date.

1527
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,790
Was there ever a time you two were alone

1528
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,760
while you were wearing the necklace?

1529
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,540
No.

1530
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,510
Anyone present with you in the bathroom?

1531
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,910
My head was in a toilet bowl.

1532
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:11,170
How 'bout after?

1533
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,180
A lot of people.

1534
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:14,780
Do you know this woman?

1535
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,750
No.

1536
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:20,180
Debbie Ocean, convicted felon.

1537
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:21,550
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1538
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:22,950
more convicted felon.

1539
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,690
She was present on the night of the incident.

1540
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:27,190
Did she steal the necklace?

1541
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:29,590
Apparently not, she's the only one with an alibi.

1542
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,090
Smiling at the camera the entire time.

1543
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,060
Ooh. So...

1544
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,540
So I have five innocent people who seem to be suspects,

1545
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,040
and someone who should be a suspect but isn't.

1546
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:42,510
I have cameras

1547
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,780
covering every inch of the museum,

1548
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:46,880
except for the loo,

1549
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,980
where $150 million was stolen from that neck, your neck.

1550
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:53,480
Interesting case.

1551
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,150
Some days, I love my job.

1552
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,060
I love my job, too.

1553
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,980
You guys are fucked.

1554
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,750
Nice place.

1555
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,950
It must be a bitch to heat.

1556
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,750
Excuse me! You are trespassing.

1557
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,860
No. We asked her to come.

1558
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:35,530
You asked her to come?

1559
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:40,030
We realized a few days ago that Miss Kluger...

1560
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:41,960
Was not a total fricking idiot.

1561
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,940
Might have gotten a sense of what we were doing.

1562
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,440
You've got one of the greatest necks in the world.

1563
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,780
First of all, if there's one thing I know,

1564
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,510
it's bad acting.

1565
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:57,180
In fact, you've got the only neck

1566
01:27:57,180 --> 01:27:58,950
that could carry this necklace off.

1567
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:01,750
And I almost never throw up.

1568
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,320
Even when I'm really wasted.

1569
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,790
It was in the water.

1570
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,990
It must have fallen off while you were running.

1571
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:12,460
And last but not least,

1572
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:14,260
I never forget a face.

1573
01:28:14,270 --> 01:28:15,630
Debbie Ocean.

1574
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,040
Yeah. Yeah. So,

1575
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,940
seems to me, eight shares of 150 million

1576
01:28:22,940 --> 01:28:26,010
is better than seven shares of nothing, right?

1577
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:28,650
Chilly!

1578
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,150
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!

1579
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:31,680
Let's not all high-five at once.

1580
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,120
Plus, I am the one who is saving your asses

1581
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:35,850
- from insurance fraud. - What?

1582
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,920
- Insurance fraud? - I was gonna get to that.

1583
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:39,360
When?

1584
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,290
It seems that they've assigned an insurance investigator...

1585
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,590
Who's about to look up your ass with a flashlight.

1586
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,630
- Who? - This little Columbo dude,

1587
01:28:45,630 --> 01:28:46,730
everything but the trench coat.

1588
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,830
Totally on to you.

1589
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:49,770
His name is John Frazier.

1590
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:51,130
- You know him? - Yes.

1591
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,800
He busted my father twice and my brother once.

1592
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:53,940
He's family.

1593
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:55,440
All right. Lest we forget,

1594
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,940
this entire enterprise was to keep me out of jail.

1595
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,340
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1596
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,340
- Are you sure? - We expected this.

1597
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:02,580
We prepared for this.

1598
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,550
Yup, that's clear.

1599
01:29:04,550 --> 01:29:07,450
We will not be the prime suspect.

1600
01:29:07,450 --> 01:29:09,350
Okay, well then who will be the prime suspect?

1601
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,660
There's a few. We've got the security guys,

1602
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:12,960
we've got the busboys...

1603
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,960
The shady guy who put you away.

1604
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,300
The boyfriend.

1605
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,200
Yup. They were gonna be looking for somebody.

1606
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,840
Just had to make sure it wasn't one of us.

1607
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:29,240
It's nice.

1608
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,040
Thanks.

1609
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,380
That is amazing! The precision...

1610
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,650
Right?

1611
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,610
It's always the attention to detail

1612
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:36,880
and the little grace notes

1613
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,720
that really make something sing.

1614
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:42,690
Why are you doing this?

1615
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:49,630
I don't have that many close female friendships.

1616
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:51,230
And book clubs are the worst.

1617
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:53,360
So I just thought

1618
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,030
this could be something fun to share.

1619
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:57,000
You're becoming a criminal because you're lonely?

1620
01:29:58,370 --> 01:30:00,740
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1621
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:02,170
Are you an only child?

1622
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:06,580
Midsummer Night's Dream in Miami?

1623
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:08,340
It's Shakespeare.

1624
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:11,410
She did summer stock at Williamstown,

1625
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,780
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

1626
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,080
What about this one? She looks good.

1627
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:16,080
Let's see. Regional theater,

1628
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:17,850
but she trained at Juilliard.

1629
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:18,960
It's really a magnificent piece.

1630
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,020
This was your mother's?

1631
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:22,590
Left to me after her passing.

1632
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,130
A Swedish prince gave it to her

1633
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:28,360
in exchange for her deflowering.

1634
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:29,930
Are they worth something?

1635
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:32,000
Yes, they're worth quite a lot.

1636
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,370
"Take these," My mother said. "Now, go."

1637
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:36,710
It was moonlight,

1638
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,140
and then he said,

1639
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:42,420
"I'd give you every star in that sky."

1640
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:45,510
I'm sorry.

1641
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,320
It must be difficult for you.

1642
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,820
- Claude Becker? - Yeah.

1643
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:53,990
- John Frazier. - Hi.

1644
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,230
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1645
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,130
So, Claude...

1646
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,200
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1647
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:03,930
Isn't it?

1648
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:05,100
What do you want?

1649
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:08,470
Here are some photographs of you

1650
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:09,910
with Miss Kluger.

1651
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:11,370
Now, as you can see, there are many photographs

1652
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:14,040
where your hand is on the back of her neck.

1653
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:16,480
I don't really remember where my hands were.

1654
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,850
Ah. To be you.

1655
01:31:18,850 --> 01:31:20,050
Right?

1656
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:22,850
Problem is,

1657
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,190
the necklace has been stolen

1658
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:26,060
and a fake has been put in its place.

1659
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,190
Right now, you're the person

1660
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,460
with the greatest opportunity...

1661
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,690
Why would I wanna steal a necklace?

1662
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,730
That's what I keep asking myself.

1663
01:31:33,670 --> 01:31:35,270
Why would this guy,

1664
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,100
who's got everything,

1665
01:31:40,370 --> 01:31:41,770
two of these...

1666
01:31:43,310 --> 01:31:45,910
Why would that guy wanna steal a necklace?

1667
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,350
What was your answer?

1668
01:31:50,950 --> 01:31:52,880
Maybe he doesn't have everything.

1669
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:54,850
I think we're done here.

1670
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:56,220
- Just a theory. - Really.

1671
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:57,550
- A shot in the dark. - We're done.

1672
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:58,990
I'm probably wrong.

1673
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:01,920
It's a beautiful piece, and I want you to have it.

1674
01:32:01,930 --> 01:32:04,330
I can't go any lower. Just hold on one second.

1675
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:07,830
Hello?

1676
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,630
Hi.

1677
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:13,100
What're you doing right now?

1678
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:21,840
Hello, John.

1679
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,150
Hello, Debbie.

1680
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:24,980
You look well, how long's it been?

1681
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:27,980
A few years. Minus good behavior.

1682
01:32:27,990 --> 01:32:29,550
- Right. - Yeah.

1683
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:31,860
Thank you for calling. I was gonna call you.

1684
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,890
- Yeah, I didn't do it. - Of course not.

1685
01:32:33,890 --> 01:32:35,420
You were just on camera 20 feet away

1686
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:36,760
while the jewels were being nicked.

1687
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:38,030
It's a coincidence.

1688
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:39,930
No. That's a solid alibi.

1689
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,300
What is it? Is it genetic?

1690
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:43,000
Are the whole family like this?

1691
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,200
Except for my aunt Ida.

1692
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,340
- Librarian? - Mmm. Homemaker.

1693
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,770
Right, I'm gonna make this easy for you.

1694
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,440
I don't want you.

1695
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:52,280
I just want the necklace.

1696
01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:54,010
I don't care. I'll say I found it in a cab.

1697
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,550
How about some of it?

1698
01:32:57,750 --> 01:33:01,080
- How much? - Hypothetically, 10%.

1699
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:02,720
And where's the hypothetical rest?

1700
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:05,590
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

1701
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,420
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

1702
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:12,330
I mean, when they said come over, I was like... Ugh.

1703
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:14,400
You know, with the jet lag, the time difference,

1704
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,300
Arsenal in the Cup Final this weekend.

1705
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,600
But now I'm here. It's bloody interesting.

1706
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,610
Yeah?

1707
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,940
So it's not just profit, it's revenge.

1708
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,380
It's a twofer.

1709
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,880
He frames you, you frame him, scores are settled.

1710
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,220
I'm just the courier.

1711
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:37,220
All is right with the world, it's brilliant.

1712
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,750
Just trying to help out an old friend.

1713
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:42,060
You know, one day, you are gonna have to let this go?

1714
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,100
And one day, I will.

1715
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,270
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

1716
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:51,870
that I do know where there's a part of that necklace.

1717
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,570
Can you get a search warrant?

1718
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:59,280
I'd need probable cause.

1719
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:03,510
Well, we may or may not be working on that right now.

1720
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:09,320
Do you wanna play a game?

1721
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,420
What kind of game?

1722
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:15,960
A card game.

1723
01:34:23,370 --> 01:34:24,470
Yes, yes!

1724
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:34,540
I'll be right back.

1725
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,520
Where are you going?

1726
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:38,580
Wait.

1727
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:00,200
Where are you?

1728
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:02,440
I'll be right there.

1729
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:12,870
You have no idea how this came to be in your possession?

1730
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,280
No.

1731
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,350
But you were Ms. Kluger's date

1732
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,820
the night these necklaces were switched.

1733
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:21,350
Yes, I was.

1734
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:26,660
Does that strike you as a rather large coincidence?

1735
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:34,030
Including a 33.18, D color, internally flawless diamond...

1737
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,960
Are you familiar with a company called

1738
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:38,130
Becker Holdings, LLC?

1739
01:36:38,140 --> 01:36:39,500
Of course.

1740
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:42,570
Well, it seems four sweet old ladies,

1741
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,340
who apparently don't exist,

1742
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:48,840
have recently transferred some very large sums of money

1743
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,720
into Becker Holdings, LLC.

1744
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:57,120
Do you know how that might have happened, Mr. Becker?

1745
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:04,960
I think I need to talk to my lawyer.

1746
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,700
I think you do.

1747
01:37:15,310 --> 01:37:17,340
- To our dear friend Carl... - Claude.

1748
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:22,110
Claude Becker. May he rest in peace in prison.

1749
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,380
Cheers.

1750
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,810
Love you, love you, love you.

1751
01:37:24,820 --> 01:37:25,850
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1752
01:37:26,980 --> 01:37:28,190
I have a question.

1753
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:29,690
So...

1754
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,450
It's good that he went to jail,

1755
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,520
'cause it's great that we didn't.

1756
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:38,290
But if you only sold the jewels for 85 million,

1757
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,470
how does it work out that we get 16 apiece?

1758
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,470
Do you wanna?

1759
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:46,970
You thought we were just gonna steal one necklace?

1760
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:50,570
What do you think we are, a bunch of pussies?

1761
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,040
See, while everyone was worried

1762
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,580
about what was happening around your neck...

1763
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,580
And you were hurling your guts out...

1764
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,780
Thanks for that, by the way.

1765
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,810
It was amazing.

1766
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,180
That was really impressive.

1767
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:01,480
That was really nice, actually.

1768
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:04,620
The place kinda went on lockdown.

1769
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:06,090
The kitchen was cleared out, too.

1770
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,860
And while everyone was watching the entrance,

1771
01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:10,860
we thought we'd check out the exhibit.

1772
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:16,200
Because why would you just steal one necklace,

1773
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,570
when you could steal more?

1774
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:24,270
- Holy shit! - Holy shit!

1775
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:25,740
That's a lot.

1776
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,040
Yeah.

1777
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:29,910
We didn't just print the Toussaint from that thing.

1778
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:31,510
We printed a lot of jewels.

1779
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:34,450
Felt like I was working at Kinko's.

1780
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:36,590
Meanwhile,

1781
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:38,590
I decided to visit an old friend.

1783
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:50,630
Amazon sells these 20-foot selfie sticks.

1784
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,640
All they saw was a quick, little blur.

1787
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:58,780
It was a temporary exhibit and they built

1788
01:38:58,780 --> 01:38:59,780
this metal grid to hang the dresses from.

1790
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:05,580
We just decided to suspend Yen from that as well.

1791
01:39:24,430 --> 01:39:26,300
What if somebody came in?

1792
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,840
Oh. Somebody did.

1793
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,310
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't be here.

1794
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:31,780
We're clearing this whole area.

1803
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,850
Ma'am.

1804
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:15,750
Calm down.

1808
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,370
We're okay.

1809
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,710
Stealing the necklace was great,

1810
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:11,440
but without that diversion,

1811
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,870
without clearing out the exhibit...

1812
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,140
We wouldn't have been able to grab these.

1813
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,450
These,

1814
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:21,720
which bring your cuts to $38,300,000 each.

1815
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,480
Yeah, I know. It's so beautiful.

1816
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:01,090
Sweetie, I know, but you can't put gum

1817
01:42:01,090 --> 01:42:02,990
in your sister's hair.

1818
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:05,830
I don't care if she tried to put it in your nose first.

1820
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:21,610
What's up, YouTube? It's your girl!

1821
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:22,750
Check out my new crib.

1822
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:24,780
I'm on the co-op board.

1824
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,120
- Cut! - That's a cut!

1825
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:33,630
- Cut, cut, cut! - That's a cut!

1826
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:35,960
Resetting back to one.

1827
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:37,890
Uh, just, you know... Smoother.

1828
01:42:37,890 --> 01:42:40,500
Just a little bit of space, please. It was perfect.

1829
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,100
I just need it faster and more damaged.

1830
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,730
All right? Great.

1831
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:45,540
It's not that hard!

1832
01:44:03,410 --> 01:44:04,950
You would've loved it.
